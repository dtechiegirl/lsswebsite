    <h2>Kayode Eso</h2>
    <span>Public Chamber</span>
  

    <p class="para">Kayode Eso Public Chamber is one of the foremost public chambers in the Law Students’ Society, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko. We are a highflying Chamber named after the renowned Hon. Justice Kayode ESO (as he then was). We are concerned with the protection and safeguard of rights of students on campus as well as the breeding of sound and competent student advocates.

        Kayode Eso Public Chamber, having risen above the stars over the years with countless feats stacked up to her name, has been able to have a “Human Right and Civil Liberty department;” a department affiliated with the Akungba Law Clinic, which comprises student advocates saddled with the responsibility of taking up cases of students’ human rights violation.
        
       <br> We have been able to not just competently represent the interests of quite a number of aggrieved students on campus, we have also been able to victoriously fight legal battles including election petitions for our student clients.
        
       <br> Beyond litigation, we also engage in the services of contract/agreement drafting, contract proofreading and review, among other legal services.
        
        We are Kayode Eso Public Chamber; we are primus inter pares.
