            The Female Law Students’ Forum is a recognized forum and affiliation under the auspices of the Law Student’s Association of Nigeria (LAWSAN). 
            <br>It was convened with the intention of bringing female law students together under one platform with the purpose of encouraging advocacy, mentorship and scholarship. The forum stands as non-religious, non-political and non-feministic in character. The Female Law Student’s Forum (FLF) AAUA Chapter was established in 2019 and the first administration was led by Praise Ajayi. The founding patrons were PROF. E.A Taiwo(the then Dean of the faculty), Mrs Oloba, Dr. Ayeni and Mrs Y.O Omotuyi, Mrs. Olori Olateru Olagbegi,  .

    <br>  FLF’s main objectives are founded in her motto; Mentorship and Advocacy. She focuses on promoting mentorship among her members as well as sharpening the advocacy skill of her members in preparation for the practical aspect of the legal field. FLF also caters for the general welfare of children by organizing seminars and helping them out in whatever way they can.
